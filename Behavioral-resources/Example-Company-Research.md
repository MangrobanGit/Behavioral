## Questions

Have at least a few questions to ask at the end of your interview. It will really make you stand out and it's your chance to get answers.

Some that I like are.

- What are the biggest opportunities/challenges facing the company?
- What does success look like in this position? And how do you measure it?
- Thinking back to the people who have been in this position previously, what differentiated the ones who were good from the ones who were great?
- What would my expectations be in the first 30, 60, 365 days?



This is how I prepare for every behavioral interview and this is exactly what I had for my interview here.
